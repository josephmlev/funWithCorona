# funWithCorona

Lets have some fun playing with Corona virus models and data! I'm envisioning the collection/visulization of data and modeling as seperate paths that will combine at some point down the road with the data used to generate peramaters for the models. No spicific goal, but I'll keep a running total of ideas below. Lets have some fun while we are stuck at home!

Some cool things to do:
1) Average time between diagnosis and death
2) Get some plots for the US (sum states)
